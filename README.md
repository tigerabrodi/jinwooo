    A note taking app inspired by Apple Notes
  </p>
</div>

## Why I made this

I use Apple Notes for my daily note taking. Of course, there are a bunch of cool apps out there. But Apple Notes is perfect. It's simple and works.

I played around with their folders and how e.g. notes count are recursively calculated. As a fan of recursion and having built a real file/folder picker in the past, I had to do this haha
